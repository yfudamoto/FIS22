## Dust temperature and IR luminosity measurement method presented in Fudamoto et al., 2022

MULTIISM_freeXi_estErr.py: This is a code that calculate Xi_clp, Td, Lir using multiple ALMA continuum measurements and dust continuum emission size.

MULTIISM_fixXi_estErr.py: This is a code thta calcuate Td, Lir using single ALMA continuum measurements and dust continuum emission size.
